# Anti-transit
Anti-transit (Nisf qaws al‑layl al‑ḥaqīqī) is the daily moment when the Sun is at the observer's lower meridian, reaching its lowest position in the sky.

During persistent twilight, this is the point at which the Sun moves from the western side of the sky to the eastern side of the sky, and twilight stops decreasing and begins to increase (meeting the definition of Fajr). This time is also equivalent to both the midpoint between Maghrib and Sunrise (Nisf al-layl al‑ḥaqīqī) and the proportion of night at the nearest place where the Fajr altitude is reached (Aqrab al-bilād). For details see [_A misunderstanding of Fajr and misapplication of Aqrab al-Ayyām during persistent twilight_](/aqrab-al-ayyam)

**Method:** The centre of the sun is at the observer's lower meridian.
