# Ẓuhr
Ẓuhr begins when the sun declines (immediately after [Istiwāʾ](/istiwa)).

<note>There is a discussion on if Ẓuhr begins immediately after [Transit](/transit) or if it begins after the decline of the sun becomes apparent. In the first case [Istiwāʾ](/istiwa) will be an instant and in the second [Istiwāʾ](/istiwa) will be a momentary period. The time shown is when the disc of the sun has crossed the upper meridian and is entirely in the West. A second time is also shown (in the web version of Muwaqqit) in terms of shadow increase over transit for a 2m gnomon. Various shadow increases are documented by [King 2003](https://brill.com/abstract/title/7640), most notably one twelfth and one quarter of a gnomon.</note>

The Shāfiʿīs and Ḥanbalīs say that Ẓuhr ends when the shadow of an object is the length of the object increased by the length of its meridian shadow. The Mālikīs hold the same but say that its extended time lasts to sundown. They also maintain that there is a shared time period between Ẓuhr and ʿAṣr the length of which is the time required to complete four rakʿah of prayer (or two for a traveller) but differ as to if this period is at the end of Ẓuhr or the beginning of ʿAṣr.

The Ḥanafīs say that Ẓuhr ends when the shadow of an object is twice the length of the object increased by the length of its meridian shadow, although the Sāhibayn hold that Ẓuhr ends when the shadow of an object is the length of the object increased by the length of its meridian shadow, in agreement with the other three schools.

The Ḥanafīs and Shāfiʿīs say that the time for the Friday prayer (Ṣalāt al-Jumuʿah) is the same as Ẓuhr. However, the Mālikīs say that its time extends until Sunset. The Ḥanbalīs say that its time begins when the sun has risen one spear length ([al-Ḍaḥwa al‑Ṣughrā](/al-dahwa-al-sughra)) and lasts until the ending time of Ẓuhr.

**Method:** The trailing limb of the sun is at the observer's upper meridian. In the web version of Muwaqqit, the time is also given in terms of shadow increase over transit for a 2m gnomon, where the increase can be set according to user preference. The default is 1mm. Positions are corrected for refraction.
