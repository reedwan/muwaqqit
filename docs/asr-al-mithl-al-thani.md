# ʿAṣr al-Mithl al‑Thānī

The Ḥanafīs say that ʿAṣr begins when the shadow of an object becomes longer than twice the length of the object increased by the length of its meridian shadow, although the Sāhibayn hold that ʿAṣr begins when the shadow of an object becomes longer than the length of an object increased by the length of its meridian shadow. For the Shāfiʿī, Ḥanbalī and Mālikī view, see [ʿAṣr al-Mithl al‑Awwal](/asr-al-mithl-al-awwal).


The Ḥanafīs maintain that ʿAṣr ends at sundown, but consider it reprehensible to delay the ʿAṣr prayer until changes becomes visible in the appearance of the Sun. The Ḥanbalīs say that ʿAṣr ends when the shadow of an object becomes twice the length of the object increased by the length of its meridian shadow, and that its extended time lasts to sundown. For the Shāfiʿī and Mālikī view, see [ʿAṣr al-Mithl al‑Awwal](/asr-al-mithl-al-awwal).

The Sun's disc is said to change visibly is when it reaches the height of a spear (rumḥ) above the horizon, or according to some when looking at the Sun's disc no longer causes discomfort to the eyes. See [Karāhah](/karahah).

**Method:** The shadow of an object is twice the length of the object increased by the length of its meridian shadow. The centre of the Sun is in the eastern half of the sky and at an altitude

<InlineMath>\alpha = \arctan\bigg(\dfrac{1}{\cot (\theta) +2}\bigg)</InlineMath>,

where 𝜃 is the altitude of the Sun at transit. Altitudes are corrected for refraction, and relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer.
