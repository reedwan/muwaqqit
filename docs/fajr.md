# Fajr
Fajr begins with the break of true dawn -- that is, twilight which appears in the East which continues to expand both horizontally and vertically.

The Ḥanafīs, Ḥanbalīs and Shāfiʿīs says that Fajr ends at Sunrise. The Mālikīs say that Fajr lasts until the brightness of the sky is such that people's faces are clearly distinguishable by someone with average sight in a place not covered by a roof, and when the stars cease to be visible; and that its extended time (for those with a legal excuse) lasts until Sunrise.

True dawn is normally preceded by the false dawn -- a column of light that extends along the ecliptic, flanked on either side by darkness. It resembles the tail of a black wolf, and corresponds to the phenomenon known as the zodiacal light. See [Redhouse 1880](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25196852).

<note>There is no mention of the false dawn by European astronomers until the late seventeenth century where it is discussed by Cassini as _la lumière répandus sur le zodiaque_. Subsequently astronomers began referring to the phenomenon as the zodiacal light.</note>

The altitude of the Sun at the time of true dawn is by the determination of many astronomers, -18°. This value along with slight variations (most notably -19°) were widely used throughout Islamic history. See [King 2003](https://brill.com/abstract/title/7640).

<note type="warning">It is not possible to determine this angle visually in regions affected by artificial anthropogenic skyglow (ie. most of the developed world). Angles as small as -15° have no pre-modern precedent and are a result of observations affected by artificial skyglow. See [Spitschan et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep26756), [Falchi et al 2016](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600377.full).</note>

When the Sun does not reach the Fajr altitude (and hence twilight is persistent), the [Anti-transit](/anti-transit) time is used. This is the point at which the Sun moves from the western side of the sky to the eastern side of the sky, and twilight stops decreasing and begins to increase (meeting the definition of Fajr). This time is also equivalent to both the midpoint between Maghrib and Sunrise (Nisf al-layl al‑ḥaqīqī) and the proportion of night at the nearest place where the Fajr altitude is reached (Aqrab al-bilād).

<note type="warning">Leaving Fajr unknown or setting it artificially (to Aqrab al-ayyām or the like) during persistent twilight is an error. Fajr is simply spreading twilight. As such it occurs even during persistent twilight. For details see [_A misapplication of Aqrab al-Ayyām during persistent twilight_](/aqrab-al-ayyam).</note>

**Method:** The centre of the Sun is in the eastern half of the sky and 𝛼 degrees below the observer's horizon, where 𝛼 is set according to user preference. The default is -18°. The altitude is relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer. Since the effects of atmospheric conditions on twilight are not considered and in all likelihood considerably significant, Muwaqqit allows for an additional uncertainty correction. This can be set according to user preference. The default is 1°. When the centre of the Sun does not reach this altitude, Fajr is set to the Anti-transit time which is when twilight stops decreasing and begins to increase (see [Anti-transit](/anti-transit)).
