# ʿIshāʾ
The Shāfiʿīs, Ḥanbalīs and Mālikīs say that ʿIshāʾ begins with the disappearance of the red twilight glow. The Ḥanafīs say that ʿIshāʾ begins with the disappearance of the white twilight glow, although the Sāhibayn hold that ʿIshāʾ begins with the disappearance of the red twilight glow, in agreement with the other three schools. The altitude of the Sun at the time of the dissapearance of the white twilight glow is by the determination of many astronomers, -18°. This value along with slight variations were widely used throughout Islamic history. See [King 2003](https://brill.com/abstract/title/7640). The difference between the disappearance of the red and white twilight glow is approximately 3°, and likely to vary with atmospheric conditions. 

<note type="warning">It is not possible to determine this angle visually in regions affected by artificial anthropogenic skyglow (ie. most of the developed world). See [Spitschan et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep26756), [Falchi et al 2016](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600377.full).</note>

The Shāfiʿīs and Ḥanafīs say that ʿIshāʾ lasts until daybreak. The Hanbalis and Malikis say that ʿIshāʾ lasts until the first third of the legal (sharʿī) night, and that only its extended time lasts until daybreak.

When the Sun does not reach the ʿIshāʾ altitude (and hence twilight is persistent), no time is given. During this period, the Ḥanafīs have two views: Some say that the obligation of ʿIshāʾ is dropped, and some say ʿIshāʾ is to be offered as qaḍāʾ (upon daybreak). The Shāfiʿīs say that ʿIshāʾ should be offered according to the ratio of night at the nearest place, ending at the local manifestation of daybreak. Practically, both the Ḥanafī view of qaḍāʾ and the Shāfiʿī view of using the ratio of night at the nearest place, are the the same. This is because ʿIshāʾ at the nearest place is momentary. Hence both place ʿIshāʾ at Anti-transit. However the Shāfiʿīs offer it immediately (by restricting it to a momentary interval) and the Ḥanafīs allow it to be delayed (as qaḍāʾ). [Hence the same time falls out of the separate principles of each school while assuming the characteristics of each school -- Maghrib for example is offered immediately by the Shāfiʿīs and by the Ḥanafīs with scope for delay (until ʿIshāʾ).] For details see [Patel 2017](https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/fajr_misunderstanding.html).

**Method:** The centre of the Sun is in the western half of the sky and 𝛼 degrees below the observer's horizon, where 𝛼 is set according to user preference. The default is -18°. The altitude is relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer. Since the effects of atmospheric conditions on twilight are not considered and in all likelihood considerably significant, Muwaqqit allows for an additional uncertainty correction. This can be set according to user preference. The default is 1°. When the centre of the Sun does not reach this altitude, no time is given.
