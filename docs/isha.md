# ʿIshāʾ
The Shāfiʿīs, Ḥanbalīs and Mālikīs say that ʿIshāʾ begins with the disappearance of the red twilight glow (al-Shafaq al-Aḥmar). The Ḥanafīs say that ʿIshāʾ begins with the disappearance of the white twilight glow (al-Shafaq al-Abyaḍ), although the Sāhibayn hold that ʿIshāʾ begins with the disappearance of the red twilight glow, in agreement with the other three schools.

The altitude of the Sun at the disappearance of the red twilight glow is -17°, and according to some -16°. See [King 2003](https://brill.com/abstract/title/7640). The difference between the disappearance of the red and white twilight glow is approximately 3°.

<note :label="false">Ibn al-Shatir [d. 777 Hijrī] writes that he observed the disappearance of red twilight (excluding yellow) at -16°, but a degree should be added to it. [_General Utility in the Practice of the Perfect Quadrant_]</note>

<note type="warning">It is not possible to determine this angle accurately in regions affected by artificial anthropogenic skyglow (ie. most of the developed world). See [Spitschan et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep26756), [Falchi et al 2016](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600377.full).</note>

The Shāfiʿīs and Ḥanafīs say that ʿIshāʾ lasts until Fajr. The Hanbalis and Malikis say that ʿIshāʾ lasts until the first third of the legal (sharʿī) night, and that only its extended time lasts until Fajr.

<note :label="false">When the Sun does not reach the ʿIshāʾ altitude (and twilight is persistent), no time is given. During this period, the Ḥanafīs have two views: Some say that the obligation of ʿIshāʾ is dropped, and some say ʿIshāʾ is to be offered as qaḍāʾ (upon the entry of Fajr). The Shāfiʿīs say that ʿIshāʾ should be offered according to the ratio of night at the nearest place where ʿIshāʾ occurs, ending at the local manifestation of Fajr. Practically, both the Ḥanafī view of qaḍāʾ and the Shāfiʿī view of using the ratio of night at the nearest place are the the same. This is because ʿIshāʾ at the nearest place is momentary. Hence both place ʿIshāʾ at Anti-transit. However the Shāfiʿīs offer it immediately (by restricting it to a momentary interval) and the Ḥanafīs allow it to be delayed (as qaḍāʾ). For details see [_A misapplication of Aqrab al-Ayyām during persistent twilight_](/aqrab-al-ayyam).</note>

The time of Witr is after the ʿIshāʾ prayer up to the beginning time of Fajr. However, the Mālikīs say that its extended time lasts until the performance of the Fajr prayer.

**Method:** The centre of the Sun is in the western half of the sky and 𝛼 degrees below the observer's horizon, where 𝛼 is set according to user preference. The default values (in the web version of Muwaqqit) are -16° for the disappearance of al-Shafaq al-Aḥmar and -19° for the disappearance al-Shafaq al-Abyaḍ. The altitude is relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer. When the centre of the Sun does not reach this altitude, no time is given. Since the effects of atmospheric conditions on twilight are not considered and in all likelihood considerably significant, Muwaqqit allows for an additional uncertainty correction. This can be set according to user preference. The default is 1°.
