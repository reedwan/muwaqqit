# Istiwāʾ
Istiwāʾ is the time when the Sun is at its zenith and prayer is forbidden. It is a momentary period in which the sun transits the celestial meridian. [Ẓuhr](/zuhr) commences immediately after Istiwāʾ.

**Method:** The leading limb of the sun is at the observer's upper meridian. The position is corrected for refraction.
