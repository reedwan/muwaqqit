# Istiwāʾ
Istiwāʾ is the period when the Sun is at its zenith and prayer is forbidden. [Ẓuhr](/zuhr) begins after Istiwāʾ.

**Method:** In Muwaqqit's implementation, the period starts when the leading limb of the sun is at the observer's upper meridian, and ends when the trailing limb of the sun is at the observer's upper meridian. The position is corrected for refraction.
