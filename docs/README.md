<h1>Introduction</h1>

Muwaqqit is project to create a comprehensive reference for ṣalāh times and astronomical data for Muslims. The web application (initially launched in Ramaḍān 2011) generates over half a million ṣalāh times for users every month.

<note>The word Muwaqqit literally means timekeeper and refers to a person who is a specialist in ʿIlm al-Mīqāt. The science of Mīqāt came out of a need to determine the times of prayer and direction of the Qiblah, and resulted in remarkable developments in mathematics, astronomy, trigonometry, algebra, map projection, mathematical geography and engineering, which underpin all of modern science. The Muwaqqit became a formal specialist office in Mosques at the beginning of the seventh century Hijrī.</note>

The project provides a number of public tools including a [web application](https://www.muwaqqit.com), [web-based mobile application](https://www.muwaqqit.com/mobile), [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/muwaqqit/id1454077724), and [API](https://www.muwaqqit.com/notes). We also provide data services to Islamic organisations, Mosques, media publishers, academic organisations, scholars, astronomers and developers.
