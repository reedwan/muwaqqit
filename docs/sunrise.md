# Shurūq/Sunrise
Shurūq/Sunrise is the moment the leading limb of the Sun appears on the apparent horizon.

<note type="warning">Despite the extreme accuracy of modern positional astronomy, calculating the precise moment of Sun (and by extension twilight) rise/set is (surprisingly) not possible because refraction near the horizon is substantial and varies based on live atmospheric conditions. See discussions by [Schaefer & Liller 1990](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1990PASP..102..796S&db_key=AST&page_ind=0&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_VIEW&classic=YES), [Young 2004](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/420806/pdf), [Sampson et al 2003](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/378214), [Wilson 2018](https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/etdr/697).</note>

**Method:** The Sun is in the eastern half of the sky and its leading limb is at the horizon. The altitude is corrected for refraction, and relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer. However, since refraction near the horizon is substantial, and current methods are based on normative models which do not account for live atmospheric conditions, there is considerable scope for uncertainty below 1°. Muwaqqit allows for an additional uncertainty range alongside the standard normative corrections for refraction. This can be set according to user preference. The default is ±1°.
