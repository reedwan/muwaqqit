# A misapplication of Aqrab al-Ayyām during persistent twilight

**Overview:** During persistent twilight, some institutions in the UK set the beginning of Fajr to approximately 1.20am. This is a misunderstanding of _Fajr_ and misapplication of _Aqrab al-Ayyām_. _Fajr_ during this period does actually manifest. It occurs at solar midnight (approximately 1am). We set forward a number of arguments — from the statements of jurists, astronomy, natural order, logic, historical practice, and verses of the Qurān — that show _Fajr_ occurs at solar midnight and why the modern understanding of _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ is both irrational and misapplied. (In this article the definition of _Maghrib_ includes white twilight unless otherwise mentioned.)

### 1. Jurists explicitly state that Fajr manifests during persistent twilight

_Fajr_ begins, in all four _madhāhib_, from the appearance of light in the east which expands both horizontally and vertically _(al-Fiqh ʿalā al-Madhāhib al-Arbaʿah)_. This occurs even during persistent twilight. During this period the signs of _ʿIshāʾ_ (the complete disappearance of twilight) do not occur, but the signs of _Fajr_ (spreading light) do. Light begins to spread at solar midnight. Hence, during this period, _Fajr_ is established by definition and it is not appropriate to make an estimation for it like we do with _ʿIshāʾ_.

<div dir="rtl">ووقت الصبح من طلوع الفجر الصادق ، وهو ضوء الشمس السابق عليها الذي يظهر من جهة المشرق، وينتشر حتى يعم الأفق ، ويصعد إلى السماء منتشرا — الفقه على المذاهب الأربعة</div>

This has been mentioned explicitly by a number of authorities including Imām Ibn ʿĀbidīn al-Shāmī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" />. He says that during persistent twilight, "The disagreement between jurists of the (Ḥanafī) school is only about the compulsion of _ʿIshāʾ_ and _Witr_. We have never seen anyone who said that _Fajr_ is also _qaḍāʾ_ in this situation. But they termed it _Fajr_. This is because _Fajr_ according to them is the name of spreading light on the horizon exactly as it is confirmed in authentic _ḥadīth_ as previously mentioned without any condition of darkness preceding it."

<div dir="rtl">الخلاف المنقول بين مشايخ المذهب إنما هو في وجوب العشاء والوتر فقط ، ولم نر أحدا منهم تعرض لقضاء الفجر في هذه الصورة ، وإنما الواقع في كلامهم تسميته فجرا ؛ لأن الفجر عندهم اسم للبياض المنتشر في الأفق موافقا للحديث الصحيح كما مر بلا تقييد بسبق ظلام . على أنا لا نسلم عدم الظلام هنا — رد المحتار على الدر المختار</div>

Jurists did not treat _Fajr_ like _ʿIshāʾ_. During persistent twilight, the signs of _ʿIshāʾ_ do not occur. Hence there is a discussion amongst jurists about the necessity and mode of offering _ʿIshāʾ_. However, Imām Ibn ʿĀbidīn <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> explains that the same discussion does not exist for _Fajr_, because jurists regarded it as occurring. He explains that _Fajr_ is simply spreading light which occurs even during persistent twilight.

Ḥanafī jurists have two opinions regarding _ʿIshāʾ_ during persistent twilight: 1) the obligation is dropped, and 2) the obligation remains as _qaḍāʾ_. Regarding the second, the Imām says, "They (our jurists) have only considered _ʿIshāʾ_ present by making it obligatory to perform after _Fajr_". If the signs of _Fajr_ also do not occur, then using the same methodology, _Fajr_ too would be offered as _qaḍāʾ_. He says that this is unheard of, because _Fajr_ is simply spreading light which occurs during persistent twilight.

<div dir="rtl">وإنما قدروه موجودا لإيجاب فعلها بعد الفجر — رد المحتار على الدر المختار</div>

The Imām explains that if _Fajr_ were to be estimated during persistent twilight it would lead to the inconsistency that "_ṣubḥ_ does not start with the (actual) rising of dawn."

<div dir="rtl">وأيضا لو فرض أن فجرهم يطلع بقدر ما يغيب الشفق في أقرب البلاد إليهم لزم اتحاد وقتي العشاء والصبح في حقهم ، أو أن الصبح لا يدخل بطلوع الفجر — رد المحتار على الدر المختار</div>

He also explains that _Fajr_ occurs even at extreme latitudes where _Maghrib_ lasts for only a few minutes. He discusses the scenario with regards to "lands where **_dawn occurs_** just as the sun is setting or sometime after it sets such that there is not enough time for a person who is fasting to eat enough food to sustain himself." The Imām says, "We cannot maintain that fasting is not obligatory under these conditions due to the existence of the reason for the fast — witnessing part of the month (of Ramadān) and the **_occurrence of dawn every day_** (‏طلوع فجر كل يوم‎)."

Since _ṭulūʿ al-Fajr_ occurs, the Imām concludes that fasting is necessary. The dispensation which the Imām gives to delay the beginning of the fast in this situation is only out of necessity to preserve one’s life and not because there is leeway in determining the actual beginning of dawn.

<div dir="rtl">لم أر من تعرض عندنا لحكم صومهم فيما إذا كان يطلع الفجر عندهم كما تغيب الشمس أو بعده بزمان لا يقدر فيه الصائم على أكل ما يقيم بنيته … ولا يمكن القول هنا بعدم الوجوب أصلا كالعشاء عند القائل به فيها ; لأن علة عدم الوجوب فيها عند القائل به عدم السبب ، وفي الصوم قد وجد السبب وهو شهود جزء من الشهر وطلوع فجر كل يوم — رد المحتار على الدر المختار</div>

Imām Aḥmad al-Ṭaḥṭāwī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says that in places where there is persistent twilight, "**_Fajr_ _occurs_** with the manifestation of whiteness spreading from the eastern side (of the sky)." This occurs at solar midnight. He too explains that darkness is not a condition for _Fajr_.

<div dir="rtl">ووجود الفجر بظهور البياض منتشرا من جهة المشرق — حاشية الطحطاوي على الدر المختار</div>

He says, "And where **_dawn occurs_** (‏طلع الفجر‎) before the ending of the red twilight (of _Maghrib_), their fast is for (almost) the entire night. They should only eat once or twice with a short gap, **_before the appearance of dawn_**."

<div dir="rtl">و حيث يطلع الفجر قبل مغيب الشفق الاحمر أنهم في الصوم في مدة الليل يأكلون فيها اما مرة واحدة أو مرتين بفاصل يسير قبل ظهر الفجر — حاشية الطحطاوي على الدر المختار</div>

Imām Badr al-Dīn al-ʿAynī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says, "It is said that some of the people of Bolghar do not find the time of _ʿIshāʾ_ for (approximately) 40 nights every year. As the sun sets from the west, **_dawn appears_** (‏يظهر الفجر‎) from the east." This occurs at solar midnight.

<div dir="rtl">قال العيني: ويذكر أن بعض أهل بلغار لا يجدون في كل سنة وقت العشاء أربعين ليلة ، فإن الشمس كما تغرب من ناحية المغرب يظهر الفجر من المشرق — حاشية الشلبي على شرح الزيلعي</div>

Imām al-Zaylaʿī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says, "Those who do not find the time of _ʿIshāʾ_ and _Witr_ because they are living in a place where **_dawn rises_** (‏طلع الفجر‎) after sunset or before _shafaq_ disappears, they (_ʿIshāʾ_ and _Witr_) are not necessary upon them because there is no cause…"

<div dir="rtl">من لم يجد وقت العشاء والوتر بأن كان في بلد يطلع الفجر فيه كما تغرب الشمس أو قبل أن تغيب الشفق لم يجبا عليه ، لعدم السبب وهو الوقت ، وذكر المرغيناني : أن الشيخ برهان الدين الكبير أفتى بأن عليه صلاة العشاء ، ثم إنه لا ينوي القضاء في الصحيح ، لفقد وقت الأداء ، وفيه نظر ؛ لأن الوجوب بدون السبب لا يعقل ، وكذا إذا لم ينو القضاء يكون أداء ضرورة ، وهو فرض الوقت ، ولم يقل به أحد ، إذ لا يبقى وقت العشاء بعد طلوع الفجر إجماعا — شرحه الزيلعي على الكنز</div>

It is very clear from these statements that during persistent twilight authorities in the Ḥanafī school regarded _Fajr_ as having a real beginning. This is when twilight begins to rise/spread. This occurs when the sun moves from the western hemisphere to the eastern hemisphere at solar midnight. As such the discussion on necessity, estimation and _qaḍāʾ_ was not for _Fajr_, but only _ʿIshāʾ_.

Persistent twilight has also been discussed by a number of Shāfiʿī jurists. Qāḍī Ḥusayn al-Murūzī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says, "As for those inhabitants of lands where nights are short and the evening twilight does not fade, they should pray _ʿIshāʾ_ when such time has passed as the extent of twilight in the lands closest to them."

<div dir="rtl">ولفظ الشافعي (رضي الله عنه) دال عليه، ألا تراه يقول في المختصر: وإذا غاب الشفق وهو الحمرة فهو أول وقت العشاء، ثم غروب الشفق ظاهر في معظم النواحي. أما الساكنون بناحية تقصر لياليهم ولا يغيب عنهم الشفق فيصلون العشاء إذا مضى من الزمان قدر ما يغيب فيه الشفق في أقرب البلدان إليهم، ذكره القاضي حسين في فتاويه — العزيز شرح الوجيز المعروف بالشرح الكبير ط العلمية</div>

This position is reaffirmed by Imām al-Rifāʿī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" />, Imām al-Nawawī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> and others. It is clear from their discussion that they only considered the problem of prayer during persistent twilight to do with _ʿIshāʾ_. They did not consider _Fajr_ similarly affected. Moreover they refer to its occurrence as normal. This is because (as Ibn ʿĀbidīn explains) _Fajr_ is simply the term for spreading light, which occurs during persistent twilight.

Imām Ibn Ḥajar al-Haytamī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says that artificially setting _Fajr_ during persistent twilight is very far fetched (‏بعيد جدا‎) because it overrides the local manifestation of dawn. He says, "Some also considered the nearest place for _Fajr_, but this is very far fetched (incorrect). How can the **_physical manifestation of Fajr with them_** be cancelled and replaced by _Fajr_ of a place near to them?"

<div dir="rtl">ثم رأيت بعضهم ذكر في صورتنا هذه اعتبار غيبوبة الشفق بالأقرب وإن أدى إلى طلوع فجر هؤلاء فلا يدخل به وقت الصبح عند هم ، بل يعتبرون أيضا بفجر أقرب البلاد إليهم وهو بعيد جدا إذ مع وجود فجر لهم حسي كيف يمكن إلغاؤه ويعتبر فجر الأقرب إليهم — تحفة المحتاج في شرح المنهاج</div>

Note that the suggestion here of some (unnamed) using the nearest place for _Fajr_ is because their method of estimating _ʿIshāʾ_ (by adding the absolute time period of _Maghrib_ at the nearest place to the local time of _Maghrib_) places _ʿIshāʾ_ after the local time of _Fajr_. This contravenes the universal principle that _Fajr_ follows _ʿIshāʾ_. Hence they are **_forced_** to set _Fajr_ artificially to keep the necessary sequence of _ṣalāḥ_. Ibn Ḥajar <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says setting _Fajr_ like this is very far fetched because it overrides the local manifestation of dawn. The same contention is mentioned by Ibn ʿĀbidīn <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> above. The proper way of setting _ʿIshāʾ_, which would not lead to this irregularity, is by using ratios as Imām Ibn Ḥajar <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> and others explain (further detail in Section ii).

<note>Using the nearest place for _ʿIshāʾ_ and _Fajr_ by ratio, sets _Fajr_ to solar midnight. This is because at the nearest place _ʿIshāʾ_ is momentary. Hence half the night will be _Maghrib_ and half the night _Fajr_. In essence, both the Ḥanafī solution of _qaḍāʾ_ and the Shāfiʿī solution of using the nearest place are the same. Both place _ʿIshāʾ_ at solar midnight. However the Shāfiʿīs offer it immediately (by restricting it to a momentary interval) and the Ḥanafīs allow it to be delayed (as _qaḍāʾ_). Hence the same time falls out of the separate principles of each school while assuming the characteristics of each school — _Maghrib_ for example is offered immediately by the Shāfiʿīs and by the Ḥanafīs with scope for delay (until _ʿIshāʾ_).</note>

Authorities in the Shāfiʿī school give permission to use an artificial time for dawn in only two scenarios: 1) when there is no complete cycle of sunset and sunrise in one day, and 2) when there is not enough time between _Maghrib_ and _Fajr_ in Ramadān to eat enough to preserve one’s life. This is for extreme latitudes and not for the UK. Moreover the second is only with regards to fasting and not _Fajr_ prayer.

Imām Aḥmad al-Ramlī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says that "If _ʿIshāʾ_ time does not occur and _Fajr_ (‏طلع الفجر‎) was immediately after sunset, _qaḍāʾ_ becomes binding."

<div dir="rtl">لو عدم وقت العشاء كأن طلع الفجر كما غربت الشمس وجب قضاؤها على الأوجه من اختلاف فيه بين المتأخرين ولو لم تغب إلا بقدر ما بين العشاءين فأطلق الشيخ أبو حامد أنه يعتبر حالهم بأقرب بلد يليهم وفرع عليه الزركشي وابن العماد أنهم يقدرون في الصوم ليلهم بأقرب بلد إليهم ، ثم يمسكون إلى الغروب بأقرب بلد إليهم وما قالاه إنما يظهر إن لم تسع مدة غيبوبتها أكل ما يقيم بنية الصائم لتعذر العمل به عندهم فاضطررنا إلى ذلك التقدير بخلاف ما إذا وسع ذلك وليس هذا حينئذ كأيام الدجال لوجود الليل هنا وإن قصر ولو لم يسع ذلك إلا قدر المغرب أو أكل الصائم قدم أكله وقضى المغرب فيما يظهر — نهاية المحتاج إلى شرح المنهاج</div>

<div dir="rtl">قوله وجب قضاؤها: أي وقضاء المغرب — حاشية الشرواني</div>

In other words, if the period of _ʿIshāʾ_ does not occur and the period of _Maghrib_ is so momentary that _Maghrib_ cannot be offered on time, _ʿIshāʾ_ as well as _Maghrib_ will be offered as _qaḍāʾ_. It will not be allowed to assume an artificial time for _Maghrib_ and _Fajr_. An artificial time can only be assumed out of necessity to preserve a fasting person’s life or if there is no complete cycle of sunrise and sunset in one day.

He continues to explain, "(al-Zarkashī and Ibn ʿImād) have allowed (using the timing of night in the nearest place) as long as the time of the disappearance of the sun does not allow a fasting person to eat sufficiently, due to this being difficult to act on. Thus, they are forced to use such an approximation. This is contrary to if there was sufficient time to eat. This cannot be compared to the days of Dajjāl as night does exist in this scenario even though it is minimal. If the night becomes so short that there is only time to eat or to perform _Maghrib_, one will eat and perform _Maghrib_ as _qaḍāʾ_."

Even in the extreme situation of not having time to offer _Maghrib_ and eat before dawn, it will not be permitted to assume an artificial time for dawn. A person will eat and pray _Maghrib_ as _qaḍāʾ_. A person will only have recourse to estimation for _suḥūr_ if there is not enough time to eat to sustain himself. This is out of necessity to preserve his life. It is clear from this that if the physical signs of _ṣalāḥ_ occur, no matter how briefly, they must be observed. If a person is unable to pray on time, he will make _qaḍāʾ_.

Imām Aḥmad al-Ramlī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> further explains that estimating a time for fasting can be acceptable if the gap between sunset and _Fajr_ is only for the length of time between both _ʿIshāʾ_s (ie. the time between the ending of red and white twilights). This is 3° (as explained by Imām al-Sharwānī in his metacommentary), which is about 15 minutes (for him). If sunset to _Fajr_ is for 15 minutes or less then a person has recourse (for fasting) to adopt the night of the nearest place where there is sufficient time to eat. This only occurs near the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. In places where sunset to _Fajr_ is longer than 15 minutes, a fasting person can eat enough to sustain himself, and hence there is no necessity to impose an artificial night over the actual times of sunset and dawn.

What is also apparent from this discussion is that estimation based on analogy of the _ḥadīth_ of Dajjāl can only be used when there is no complete cycle of sunset and sunrise in one day. Moreover, the Ḥanafīs hold that the _ḥadīth_ of Dajjāl is specific to that particular supernatural event and cannot be applied by analogy to other than it. Imām al-Ṭaḥṭāwī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says, "As for the _ḥadīth_ of Dajjāl, it is stated that it goes against _qiyās_, so we cannot do _qiyās_ of other situations based on this _ḥadīth_." Both these situations (no sunset and sunrise in one day, and the specific supernatural event mentioned) do not apply to the UK.

<div dir="rtl">وقياسه على يوم الدجال لايصح اذ لا مدخل للقياس في وضع الاسباب وايضا لا يكون القياس على امر يخالف القياس وحديث الدجال خلف القياس فلا يقاس غيره عليه حتى قال عياض لو وكلنا لا جتهادنا لا كتفينا بالصلوات الخمس ، اه على ان الاوقات موجودة في اجزاء ذالك الزمان تقديرا بحكم الشارع ولا كذالك هنا فلا مساواة حتى يقاس احدهما على الاخر الخ — حاشية الطحطاوي على الدر المختار</div>


The summary of these discussions is that during persistent twilight, _Fajr_ does indeed occur. _Fajr_ is simply a term for spreading light on the horizon, and as such it occurs even during persistent twilight as explicitly explained by multiple authorities from multiple schools.

Twilight begins to rise and spread at solar midnight. This is an astronomical fact. Estimation during this period is only for _ʿIshāʾ_ because the definition of _ʿIshāʾ_ is not met. The definition of _Fajr_ (spreading twilight) occurs. To artificially set _Fajr_ to another time is contrary to reality.

Briefly, four positions have been mentioned for _ʿIshāʾ_ during persistent twilight, in the discussions above: 1. _ʿIshāʾ_ is to be offered at the disappearance of red twilight (when this occurs); 2. the obligation drops; 3. _ʿIshāʾ_ is to be offered as _qaḍāʾ_ (after _ṭulūʿ al-Fajr_); and 4. _ʿIshāʾ_ is to be offered according to the timing of the nearest place where _ʿIshāʾ_ occurs.

These four positions, are practically demonstrated by the people of Bolghar as described by Muftī Hārūn al-Marjānī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" />. Bolghar was a significant Muslim city (largely Ḥanafī) from the 4th to 9th century AH, located in present day Russia at a latitude of 55° (similar to that of the UK).

Muftī Hārūn al-Marjānī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says that during persistent twilight in Bolghar: some considered the obligation of _ʿIshāʾ_ had dropped (as per 2 above); some considered that _ʿIshāʾ_ should be offered individually out of fear it may not be an obligatory prayer (as per 2); some considered _ʿIshāʾ_ according to other _madhāhib_ (as per 1 and 4); some considered the disappearance of red twilight for _ʿIshāʾ_ (as per 1); some held that the twilight of _Maghrib_ disappeared from the side the sun sets (the west) and the twilight of _Fajr_ appeared from the side the sun rises (the east) and would therefore not eat after half the night if they were fasting (as per solar midnight); some prayed _ʿIshāʾ_ during the night but with the intention of _qaḍāʾ_ of _ʿIshāʾ_ the night before (as per 3); some considered half the night for _ʿIshāʾ_ (as per 3); and some considered the nearest place where _ʿIshāʾ_ occurred for _ʿIshāʾ_ (as per 4).

All of these practises fit into our discussion above. _ʿIshāʾ_ was offered according to the four positions mentioned, but _Fajr_ was only offered according to solar midnight. Jurists regarded _Fajr_ as occurring, as previously mentioned from Imām Badr al-Dīn al-ʿAynī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> that in Bolghar "…dawn appears from the east." This occurs at solar midnight. Hence there is no mention by Muftī Hārūn al-Marjānī of _Fajr_ being offered at any other time. Specifically he says, "Some consider that the twilight of _Maghrib_ disappears from the side the sun sets. What remains on the other side from which the sun rises, after the sun reaches the lower meridian (‏خط نصف النهار‎), is classed as dawn. This is why they regarded eating _suḥūr_ after half the night forbidden during this period."

<div dir="rtl">من يقول ان الشفق يغيب من جهة الغرب ومحل الأفول واما ما يبقى فى الجانب الاخر وجهة الطلوع بعد وصول الشمس الى خط نصف النهار (lower meridian) فى انحطاطها فهو محسوب من الصبح ولذا منع بعض من زعم سقوط العشاء عن أكل السحر بعد نصف الليل فى هذه الاوقات — ناظورة الحق</div>

The same stance (of furthering various methods for setting _ʿIshāʾ_ while regarding _Fajr_ as occurring) is also taken by contemporary jurists such as Muftī ʿAbd al-Raḥīm Lajpurī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> and Muftī Rashīd Aḥmad Ludhiānwī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" />. Muftī Rashīd (perhaps by virtue of his expertise in astronomy) explicitly states that it is an astronomical fact that _Fajr_ begins at solar midnight during persistent twilight (further detail in Section ii).

### 2. Using a fixed time of 1.20am throughout the persistent twilight period is not Aqrab al-Ayyām

The length of a _sharʿī_ day is from _Maghrib_ to _Maghrib_. This is slightly different to the civil day that we commonly use. The length of a civil day is exactly 86,400 seconds. The length of a _sharʿī_ day changes daily and is slightly shorter or longer than the civil day. Since the civil day is a fixed arbitrary period of 86,400 seconds, it cannot be used to set _Aqrab al-Ayyām_. _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ must be fixed in realtion to the _sharʿī_ day, and not a fixed arbitary period of time. In setting _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ to the _sharʿī_ day, the calculated time of _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ will change daily, because the length of the real day changes every day.

Setting _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ using the _sharʿī_ day is done by using the ratio of twilight duration to night duration on the last day and applying this ratio to the day for which _ʿIshāʾ_ is to be estimated.

Imām Ibn Ḥajar Al-Haytamī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> explains the method for estimating _ʿIshāʾ_ during persistent twilight. He says, "One should look at the period of _Maghrib_ at the nearest place. If the ratio (of _Maghrib_ to night at the nearest place) is 1⁄6 then that ratio should be used for _Maghrib_ locally, and the remaining time will be for _ʿIshāʾ_ even if it is very short." Note that not using ratios but the absolute length of _Maghrib_ for setting the local time of _ʿIshāʾ_ can lead to overriding the local manifestation of dawn and sunrise which is not proper as mentioned by the Imām previously.

<div dir="rtl">وإنما الذي ينبغي أن ينسب وقت المغرب عند أولئك إلى ليلهم فإن كان السدس مثلا جعلنا ليل هؤلاء سدسه وقت المغرب وبقيته وقت العشاء وإن قصر جدا — تحفة المحتاج في شرح المنهاج</div>

The same method of estimating _ʿIshāʾ_ is also mentioned referenced from the Shāfiʿī school by Imām al-Ṭaḥṭāwī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> and by contemporary jurists such as Muftī Rashīd Ludhiānwī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" />. Muftī Rashīd <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says, "You will look at the gap for _ʿIshāʾ_ after sunset on the last day, and then use this ratio to calculate the beginning of _ʿIshāʾ_. The ending time of _ʿIshāʾ_ will be solar midnight."

<div dir="rtl">والثانية أن ينظر إلى وقت العشاء في القريبة منها ماذا يكون من ليلهم فبقدر هذه النسبة يفعل في هؤلاء فإن كان السدس جعلنا لهؤلاء سدسهوقت المغرب وبقيته وقت العشاء وإن قصر جدا الخ — حاشية الطحطاوي على الدر المختار</div>

Muftī Rashīd <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> is very clear that during persistent twilight _Fajr_ does occur, and that it begins at solar midnight by definition (not by estimation). He says, "In principle this fact is known that the twilight before solar midnight belongs to _Maghrib_ and the twilight after solar midnight belongs to _Fajr_."

<div dir="rtl">ان حضرات نے یہ تصریح نہیں فرمائی کہ عشاء کی نماز کس وقت پڑھے، اصولاً یہ امر ظاہر ہے کہ نصف شب سے قبل کی شفق مغرب میں داخل ہے اور اس کے بعد کی فجر میں، اس اصول اور حدیث دجال کے پیش نظریہ ثابت ہوتا ہے کہ اس علاقہ میں جن ایام میں شفق احمر غائب ہوتی تھی ان میں سے سب سے آخری دن میں غروب آفتاب کی جتنی دیر بعد عشاء کا وقت شروع ہوا تھا اب بھی اتنی ہی دیر کے بعد وقت عشاء کی ابتداء فرض کی جائے گی اور اس کی انتہاء نصف شب پر ہوگی — احسن الفتاوى</div>

As mentioned, _ʿIshāʾ_ is set by applying the ratio of _Maghrib_ to night at the closest day/place to the local night everyday. The length of night and the civil time of _Maghrib_ change everyday, and so the time of _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ will also change throughout the persistent twilight period. For example, if the ratio of _Maghrib_ to night on the last day is 9⁄10 and the local time of _Maghrib_ is 8pm and the night is 5 hours long, then _ʿIshāʾ_ will be calculated at 12:30am. When the local time of _Maghrib_ becomes 10pm and the length of the night becomes 3 hours long, then _ʿIshāʾ_ will be calculated at 12:42am. Using a fixed time of 12.30am throughout the twilight period is not a correct determination of _Aqrab al-Ayyām_. Just as the times of _Maghrib_ and the length of night change everyday, so too will the calculated time of _ʿIshāʾ_.

### 3. Aqrab al-Ayyām is not always at 1.20am

_Aqrab al-Ayyām_ does not always occur at 1.20am. The actual last day time can be many minutes earlier. As latitude changes, the last day time will occur anywhere from solar midnight onwards (approximately 1am to 1.25am in England) depending on location and year. Different areas of England will enter into persistent twilight on different days. Places in each of these areas will go through the full range of times from 1am to 1.25am, and the time will change every year.

For example, Queens Road, Walthamstow (lat: 51.5785°, lon: -0.0234°) has the following last day times according to Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office: 1:07am (2017), 1:13am (2018), 1:17am (2019), 1.20am (2020).

When the calculated time is too early, some institutes take the step of ignoring the last day time and using the time on the day before the last day. For example they say, "Using the exact last day causes problems particularly during leap year so the day immediately before the last is used." This keeps _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ near the customary time of 1.20am.

Hence _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ as implemented today is three times removed from proper usage: 1) by using it for _Fajr_ which occurs, 2) by fixing it in civil time instead of _sharʿī_ time, and 3) by often not using the actual time on the actual last day for that particular location.

### 4. The margin of error on the last day is too large to fix dawn to the minute

_Fajr_ is a visual phenomenon which is affected by a number of unpredictable factors such as refraction and composition of the atmosphere. These change daily. As such calculated _Fajr_ times come with a margin of error. In texts and scientific literature we rarely find dawn quoted to more precision than half a degree. Usually we can ignore the uncertainty because it is only in the order of a few minutes. However when we calculate _Fajr_ on and around the last day, the sun is near inflection. Because of this, on and around the last day, the uncertainty is in the order of tens of minutes. Hence precaution would require ending _suḥūr_ at the beginning of this uncertainty period and offering _Fajr_ prayer after it. Fixing a single time within this uncertainty range for both ending _suḥūr_ and beginning _ṣalāḥ_ would be inaccurate. By doing so, half of the time _suḥūr_ would be exceeded and the other half of the time _Fajr_ prayer would be offered early.

For example, on 22/11/2017 in Beckton, London (lat: 51.5°, lon: 0.05°) the time of _Fajr_ (18°) is 5:30am. An accuracy of a quarter of a degree gives an uncertainty of ±2 minutes. However on the last day (22/05/2017) the time of _Fajr_ is 1.15am with an uncertainty of ±15 minutes. In other words, using a very nominal variability of a quarter of a degree, we can only calculate when dawn will appear on this day to ±15 minutes. In this situation, fasting would need to be set at 1am and _ṣalāḥ_ at 1.30am. Using _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ while being aware of the limits of calculating dawn on the last day is ultimately equivalent to setting the time of fasting to solar midnight.

### 5. Setting dawn for shorter nights to later than places with longer nights is not rational

Using _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ for _Fajr_ causes a break of the natural order. We know that in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer, as you travel directly south, the night becomes longer and hence _Fajr_ becomes later. It is not possible that _Fajr_ at a lower latitude will be earlier than _Fajr_ at a higher latitude. Fixing _Fajr_ to 1.20am creates a situation where locations at a lower latitude, which have not yet entered into persistent twilight, can have an earlier _Fajr_ time to places at a higher latitude. This is not consistent with rationality.

For example, Leicester enters into persistent twilight on 18/05/2017. During persistent twilight, _Fajr_ time is set by estimation to 1.20am. On 22/05/2017, Beckton in London is still experiencing normal nights. The calculated time of _Fajr_ is 1.15am. Hence Beckton, which is at a lower latitude and has longer night to Leicester, has an earlier _Fajr_ time to it. This is not rational. 1.20am cannot therefore be an accurate estimation of _Fajr_ in Leicester on that date.

If an estimated time of _Fajr_ is later than the real time at a lower latitude, then the estimation method is evidently incorrect. This occurs when using _Aqrab al-Ayyām_. It does not occur however when using closest place or solar midnight. Perhaps this is why authorities in the Shāfiʿī school do not mention taking the time of the closest day, but rather the closest place (albeit only for _ʿIshāʾ_).

### 6. Determining dawn through categorising twilight in a way that is consistent with the Qurān

The Qurān says, "And by the dawn when it brightens" and, "And by the dawn when it breathes". Imām al-Ḍaḥāk <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says the meaning of breathe is to rise. Imām Qatadah <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says that it means to brighten and advance. During persistent twilight, light begins to spread/brighten/rise/advance at solar midnight. In other words, by the time we get to 1.20am, the quality of dawn in these verses has been occurring for 20 minutes. Twilight has been spreading, brightening, rising and advancing.

<div dir="rtl">والصبح إذا أسفر (74:34)، والصبح إذا تنفس (81:18)</div>

The Qurān also says, "By the night as it envelops" and, "And by the night when it is still". Imām Ibn Kathīr <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says that envelop means covering with darkness. Imām al-Suyūṭī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says it means enshrouding with darkness. These are the two phases of night: darkening and stillness. Any method to determine _Fajr_ must be consistent with all these verses. It cannot be night when twilight is spreading and brightening. If twilight is spreading and brightening, it is _ṣubḥ_. As such _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ cannot be considered a correct method to determine the beginning of _Fajr_. The only time of _Fajr_, during persistent twilight, that is consistent with these verses is solar midnight.

### 7. Determining dawn through categorising the phases of twilight by the rising and setting of the sun

Twilight can only belong to either _Maghrib_ or dawn. We have seen that if twilight is darkening it belongs to _Maghrib_ and if it is brightening it belongs to dawn. Twilight is simply the glow of the sun. It is attached to the sun and follows it. As the sun gets closer to the horizon this light increases. As the sun moves away from the horizon after _Maghrib_, this light decreases. (Note that the false dawn is not twilight. Hence it decreases even as the sun comes closer to the horizon. It is a separate phenomenon known as zodiacal light and classified by astronomers as skyglow, not twilight.)

The sun reaches its zenith (peak) at solar midday and its nadir (lowest point) at solar midnight. In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun is exactly south when it reaches its zenith during the day and is exactly north when it reaches the nadir. At the zenith the sun moves from the eastern half of the sky to the western half of the sky and begins declining until it reaches the nadir. At the nadir the sun moves from the western half of the sky to the eastern half of the sky and begins rising until it reaches the zenith.

Hence when the sun is in the west, twilight is that of the setting sun and hence belongs to _Maghrib_, and when it is in the east twilight is that of the rising sun and hence belongs to dawn.

The twilight associated with the sun setting is always in the west and the twilight associated with the sun rising is always in the east. Hence it is impossible that twilight in the east belongs to _Maghrib_. Twilight is simply a consequence of the setting or rising of the sun.

All astronomical bodies rise when they are in the east and set when they are in the west, since rising and setting is simply a result of the Earth rotating eastwards. The Qurān says, "…Ibrāhīm said, ‘Indeed, Allāh brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.’ So the disbeliever was overwhelmed…".

<div dir="rtl">ألم تر إلى الذي حاج إبراهيم في ربه أن آتاه الله الملك إذ قال إبراهيم ربي الذي يحيي ويميت قال أنا أحيي وأميت قال إبراهيم فإن الله يأتي بالشمس من المشرق فأت بها من المغرب فبهت الذي كفر والله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين (2:258)</div>

Dr. Steve Bell, head of Her Majesty’s Nautical Almanac Office says, "The sun moves from the western half of the sky to the eastern half of the sky at lower transit (nadir)." (Twilights: Terminology, Appearance, Occurrence and Calculation, _The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office_) This is an astronomical fact just as the sun moves from the eastern half of the sky to the western half at upper transit (zenith).

If an _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ time of 1.20am is used, the sun has already been in the east and rising for 20 minutes. It is not possible that this rising twilight belongs to _Maghrib_.

### 8. Determining dawn through the symmetry of the phases of twilight

The sun’s path is symmetrical around the meridian. Since twilight simply follows the sun, the disappearance and appearance of twilight will be symmetrical. The lengths of _Maghrib_ and _Fajr_ are always the same. ʿAllāmah Ẓafar Aḥmad ʿUthmānī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> says, "The redness and whiteness that appear in the horizon after sunset both parallel the whiteness and redness that appear before sunrise, as both result from the illumination of the sun. Hence, the time between sunset and the disappearance of the white _shafaq_ is exactly the same as the time between the appearance of the whiteness of dawn until sunrise, as the scholars of mathematics and astronomy have stated explicitly." Because of this symmetry, if disappearing twilight _(shafaq)_ lasts for 1 hour, then spreading twilight _(ṣubḥ)_ will last for 1 hour. Using _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ leads to the irrational proposition that _shafaq_ lasts longer than _ṣubḥ_. The symmetry of twilight is a necessary consequence of the symmetric path of the sun.

<div dir="rtl">إن الحمرة والبياض الباديين فى الأفق بعد غروب الشمس كلاهما نظير البياض والحمرة الباديين قبل طلوع الشمس لكون كليهما من آثار أشعتها ، فمدة ما بين غروب الشمس إلى غيبوبة بياض الشفق هي المدة ما بين ظهور بياض الفجر إلى طلوع الشمس سواء بسواء كما صرح به أصحاب الرياض والهيئة — إعلاء السنن</div>
  
<div dir="rtl">وأما بياض الشفق وهو رقيق الحمرة فلا يتأخر عنها إلا قليلا قدر ما يتأخر طلوع الحمرة عن البياض في الفجر — حاشية الطحطاوي على مراقي الفلاح شرح نور الإيضاح</div>

### 9. Determining dawn through equivalence

After dawn, each subsequent moment until sunrise is also _Fajr_. Hence if _Fajr_ is when the sun is at -18°, then it is also _Fajr_ at every angle between -18° and sunrise. The scene on the eastern horizon at all angles between -18° and sunrise will be that of dawn. During persistent twilight, the scene of daybreak on the eastern horizon after solar midnight will be the same scene we would normally consider to be _Fajr_ on an ordinary day. The angle of the sun will be between -18° and sunrise.

### 10. The determination of early jurists who were also renowned astronomers

A number of early jurists who were renowned astronomers explicitly calculated the latitude of lands which would experience persistent twilight and explained that dawn there would occur at solar midnight.

Quṭb al-Dīn al-Shīrazī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> a ninth century Shāfiʿī jurist, expert astronomer and polymath says, "Where the latitude is 48.5° … _shafaq_ (the twilight of _Maghrib_) will be connected to dawn … It is classified as morning as long as the sun is in the east and it will be classified as _shafaq_ as long as the sun is in the west."

<div dir="rtl">,وحيث العرض ثمانية واربعون و نصف اذا كانت الشمس فى المنقلب الذى فى جهة العرض يتصل الشفق بالصبح لأن قوس انحطاطها من دائرة نصف النهار حينئذ يكون ثمانية عشر جزأ والان الذى هو آخر غروب الشفق يكون اول طلوع الصبح … و هذا الصبح والشفق متصل احدهما بالاخر لأنه من حساب الصبح ما دام فى الطرف الشرقى و من حساب الشفق ما دام فى الغربى — التحفة الشاهية</div>

ʿAbd al-ʿAlī al-Barjandī <img src="https://reedwan.github.io/fajr/img/ra.png" width="28" /> a tenth century Ḥanafī jurist and expert astronomer says, "When the latitude exceeds 48.5°, dawn and _shafaq_ intertwine as is mentioned in the books but it is clear that when the sun is in the west it is classified as _shafaq_ and when it is in the east it is classified as dawn."

<div dir="rtl">,ثم اذا جاوز هذا العرض ثمانية واربعين ونصفا يتداخل الصبح والشفق كما هوالمذكور فى الكتب لكن الظاهر أن الشمس اذا كانت فى النصف الغربى كان من حساب الشفق واذا كان فى النصف الشرق كان من حساب الصبح — حاشيه شرح جغمينى</div>

### 11. The logical fallacy of designating an end to _Fajr_ with no beginning; and determining dawn from its ending by induction

Some institutes have said that, "_Fajr_ ends at sunrise but does not have a beginning. Therefore the beginning must be estimated".

This statement is a logical fallacy. It is impossible that something ends which doesn’t begin. If something ends then it must have begun. So _Fajr_ exists and must have a beginning. As such, using estimation like we do with _ʿIshāʾ_ is not applicable. Things are known to exist by their definitions. We simply apply the definition of _Fajr_ to find its beginning. The definition of spreading twilight occurs at solar midnight.

Even if we only agree on sunset for the beginning of _Maghrib_ and sunrise for the ending of _Fajr_, we can still deduce that _Fajr_ begins at solar midnight through induction. We agree that the moment directly after sunset is _Maghrib_ and the moment directly before sunrise is _Fajr_. If we continue to add moments to sunset and label them as _Maghrib_, and we continue to subtract moments from sunrise and label them _Fajr_, then the point at which they meet will be solar midnight. Hence solar midnight will be the beginning of _Fajr_ by induction.

### 12. Summary

During persistent twilight, the definition of _Fajr_ (spreading light) occurs at solar midnight. As such the debate about when to pray _ṣalāḥ_ is only with regards to _ʿIshāʾ_ and _Witr_. No-one (according to Imām Ibn ʿĀbidīn) has extended this situation to _Fajr_.

The Ḥanafī position is: 1) The obligation of _ʿIshāʾ_ is dropped, or 2) it is offered as _qaḍāʾ_. The Shāfiʿī position is that _ʿIshāʾ_ is set according to the ratio of night at the nearest place and it ends at the local manifestation of _Fajr_.

Artificially setting _Fajr_ to _Aqrab al-Ayyām_, a fraction of the night (such as 1⁄7, 1⁄3, 1⁄4), a number of minutes before sunrise, or the time at a remote place (such as Makkah), is against reality and rationality, and is a modern misunderstanding of the situation.

Furthermore, the modern implementation of _Aqrab al-Ayyām_ is not according to the _sharʿī_ day, is not accurate, and in many cases does not use the proper time on the last day.

During persistent twilight, the only time for _Fajr_ that is consistent with the definition of _Fajr_, reality, verses of the Qurān, statements of jurists, logic, natural order, and laws of astronomy is solar midnight.

_And Allāh the Exalted knows best._
