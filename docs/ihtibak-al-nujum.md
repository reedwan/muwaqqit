# Iḥtibāk al‑Nujūm
Iḥtibāk al‑Nujūm is when there are so many stars in the sky that they appear to blend into each other. The Ḥanafīs consider it reprehensible to the delay the Maghrib prayer and fast beyond this time. An altitude angle of -10° is documented by [King 2003](https://brill.com/abstract/title/7640).

<note type="warning">It is not possible to visually determine this angle in regions affected by artificial anthropogenic skyglow (ie. most of the developed world). See [Spitschan et al 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep26756), [Falchi et al 2016](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600377.full).</note>

**Method:** The centre of the Sun is in the western half of the sky and 𝛼 degrees below the observer's horizon, where 𝛼 is set according to user preference. The default is -10°. The altitude is relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer.
