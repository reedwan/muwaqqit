<h1>Qiblah</h1>

The Qiblah is definied as the directon of the great circle joining a particular location to the Ka øbah, measured as an angle from the local meridian.

True bearing is the angle measured from true north. Magnetic bearing is the angle measured from magnetic north. Magnetic bearing differs from true bearing by the magnetic declination which is calculated for a particular location and time using the [International Geomagnetic Reference Field model (IGRF-12)](https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40623-015-0228-9).

Qiblah solar time is the time the Sun is in the direction of the Qiblah. This time is also calculated in terms of shadow direction.
