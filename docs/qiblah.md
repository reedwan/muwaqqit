<h1>Qiblah</h1>

The Qiblah is defined as the direction of the great circle joining a particular location to the Kaʿbah. True bearing is the direction measured from true north. Magnetic bearing is the direction measured from magnetic north. Magnetic bearing differs from true bearing by the magnetic declination which is calculated for a particular location and time using the [International Geomagnetic Reference Field model (IGRF-12)](https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40623-015-0228-9).

Qiblah solar time is the time the Sun is in the direction of the Kaʿbah. This time is also calculated in terms of shadow direction.
