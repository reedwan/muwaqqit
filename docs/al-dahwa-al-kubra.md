# al-Ḍaḥwa al‑Kubrā
al-Ḍaḥwa al‑Kubrā (Nisf al‑nahār al‑sharʿī) is the legal (sharʿī) time of midday. It is the time midway between Fajr and Sunset. The Ḥanafīs say that this is the time up to which one may form intention to fast for Ramaḍān, specifically vowed, and voluntary fasts, on condition that one has not done anything that would have otherwise invalidated the fast.

**Method:** The time midway between Fajr and Sunset.
