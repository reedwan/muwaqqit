# al-Ḍaḥwa al‑Ṣughrā
al-Ḍaḥwa al‑Ṣughrā (also referred to as Ḍuhā) begins when the Sun is elevated one spear length, and lasts until Istiwāʾ. This is also the period of the ʿĪd prayer for the Ḥanafīs, Ḥanbalīs and Mālikīs. The Shāfiʿīs say the time for ʿĪd prayer is from Sunrise to Istiwāʾ.

A spear (rumḥ) is 12 spans and as a measure in astronomy, 4.5°. Variations, notably 5°, have also been documented.

**Method:** The centre of the Sun is in the eastern half of the sky and 𝛼 degrees above the observer's horizon. The default is 4.5°. The altitude is corrected for refraction, and relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer.
