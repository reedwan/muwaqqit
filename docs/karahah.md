The Ḥanafīs consider it reprehensible to delay the ʿAṣr prayer until changes becomes visible in the appearance of the Sun. The Sun's disc is said to change visibly when it reaches the height of a spear (rumḥ) above the horizon, or according to some when looking at the Sun's disc no longer causes discomfort to the eyes. The former is 12 spans and as a measure in astronomy, 4.5°. Variations, notably 5°, have also been documented.

**Method:** The centre of the Sun is in the western half of the sky and 𝛼 degrees above the observer's horizon. The default is 4.5°. The altitude is corrected for refraction, and relative to the observer's apparent horizon. The apparent horizon is the astronomical horizon corrected for the relative elevation of the observer.
